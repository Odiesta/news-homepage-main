## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript DOM

### What I learned

I learn and practice a lot of CSS Grid. Setting the grid for responsive is one of the challenging thing to create. It takes me days to figure out. The navigation part was also hard. but i figure it out.

In creating the mobile navigation i just create a separate navigation that only shown in smaller screen (600px).

I think i need complex code in javascript but it was very simple. I just need to create a function that add and remove class.

### Continued development

This project is good, i practice writing html, css, javascript from scratch. Not like i've done before like watching tutorial and doing challenge from tutorial. I plan to go deeper to javascript.
